The program takes an input excel file on which prediction has to be made. So both training set excel file "Languages_sentiment_labels.xlsx" and the testing excel file should be present in the same directory at the time of execution. Testing excel file is to be given as command line argument. Now the program prints language wise (i.e an array of six elemnts each corresponding to a given language in order 'bn','mr','en','hi','ta','te') the predicted sentiment and the compound score. Due to lack of time I was only able to print the results.

To predict the sentiment first I took the data from excel using pandas and converted the sentiments into numerical values (positive=1, negative=-1, neutral=0). Then I cleaned the text using clean function. After which I encoded the training and testing data using one hot encoding method and made corresponding vectors from the cleaned text. Then I trained a logistic regression classifier to classify the sentiments of the testing data. Logistic regression classifier also gave coffecients of each word used for making the vector for each sentiment i.e. the contribution of each word in the encoding for a particular sentiment. I multiplied these coffecients with each vector in the testing set to get the score of each tweet and then I normalised the scores between(1,-1) to get the predicted score.
